# HW5 - Configuration Management

Create an ansible playbook that is able to:

* **Setup: (50 points)** Install the following items:
    * Install node.js
    * Install forever
    * Pull/clone git repo into a destination: https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/App
    * Install npm packages
    
* **Tasks: (50 points)**:
    * Run app: `forever start node main.js`
    * Security: Create a task that ensures `bash`, `openssl`, `openssh-client`, and `openssh-server` are running latest version.
    * Cleanup: Remove content in `/tmp/*`
 
* **Provision: (BONUS: 20 points)** Create a new virtual machine from a virtual machine provider (Amazon EC2, Digital Ocean droplets, etc.)
  - If you do not do this through a cloud provider, you can instead use a local vagrant virtual machine -- but receive no bonus.
