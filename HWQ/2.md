## Patterns

#### OO Patterns

There are many design patterns that have been defined and used in building software. For object-oriented design patterns, they can be described in [three major categories](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns):

* Creational Patterns
* Structural patterns
* Behavioral patterns

Define and describe 2 design patterns from each category.

#### Free Style

Design patterns have been critized for being too specific and artifically limited by OO language constraints. Find and describe any pattern that may be useful in building software.

Define and describe 3 patterns that you have found.

## Questions

1. Github recently introduced a [GraphQL-based API](http://githubengineering.com/the-github-graphql-api/) as an alternative to a RESTful API.

  Compare and contrast a GraphQL-based API versus a RESTful API. What are some advantages and disadvantages of each approach? How might the affect the experience of a developer using the API and developers building and supportin the API?

2. Create an architectural diagram that represents a software design for [Pokemon Go](http://www.pokemongo.com/). List the primary tasks that you think would be performed with the software. Write a paragraph that describes the primary concepts and constraints of the system and that describes your overall architecture. You are free to use your best judgement in selecting a design, but you must justify your choices.
